<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
  Hello! I’m <strong>Moshe Yakubov</strong>, a passionate backend developer specializing in Django and Python.
  I love crafting clean, efficient, and scalable web applications that solve real problems.
</p>

<p>
  With a solid foundation in C, C++, Java, and Python, I’m continuously expanding my skills and embracing
  new technologies to deliver modern and maintainable software solutions.
</p>

<p>
  When I’m not coding, I enjoy studying religious texts, exploring nature, and diving into books that
  inspire both mind and soul.
</p>

<p>
  I believe in continuous growth, both professionally and personally, and I’m always eager to collaborate
  on meaningful projects and learn from others.
</p>

<p>
  Feel free to reach out if you want to connect or discuss exciting development opportunities!
